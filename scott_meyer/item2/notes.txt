1.	auto plays the role of T in the template, and
	the type specifier for the variable acts as ParamType. 

2.	auto type deduction works like template type deduction

3.  difference between auto and template type deduction is that auto
	assumes that a braced initializer represents a std::initializer_list, but template
	type deduction doesnâ€™t.

4.	To extend the lifetime of a object use auto &&.
	Copy elision however does it normally.
